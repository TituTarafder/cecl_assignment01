## Introduction

Bangladesh is on a transformative journey toward a Smart Bangladesh by 2041. However, this rapid digitization increases exposure to cyber threats such as hacking, financial fraud, and digital misinformation. While foundational laws like the ICT Act (2006), DSA (2018), and CSA (2023) exist, they remain insufficiently equipped to handle modern cyber challenges.

This assignment explores global best practices from the USA, UK, Canada, China, and India and proposes five legal reforms tailored to Bangladesh's needs.
